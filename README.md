# Customizable robot / RC car wheel rim

![Example rim design](https://github.com/torwanbukaj/robot-rc-car-wheel-rim/img/rim_example_openscad.png?raw=true)

This OpenSCAD project can be used for designing your custom robot or RC car wheel rim which you can then 3D print and use with a tire of your choice.

## How does it work?
1. You will need OpenSCAD - download it from here: https://openscad.org/downloads.html,
2. Take measurements of your tire,
3. Modify OpenSCAD project file "variables" (these are not technically variables but let's call them like this) in "Tire and rim dimensions" section acroding to your measurements (find the project file in the "src" directory of this repository),
3. Render the final shape (F6), generate STL file (F7), slice it with a slicer of your selection and just 3D print :)
